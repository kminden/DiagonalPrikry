%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW
In this talk I plan to give an introduction to subcomplete forcing, and the methodology of showing a forcing notion is subcomplete. Specifically I plan to give an idea as to how to show that a simplified version of what I refer to as generalized diagonal Prikry forcing is subcomplete, which hints to us that many Prikry-like forcings are subcomplete. In particular, letting $D$ be an infinite discrete set of measurable cardinals, I show that the forcing to add a point below each cardinal in $D$ is subcomplete.
